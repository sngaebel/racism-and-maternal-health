            <p>"Birth Justice is a movement that believes when birthing people recognize their innate 
                power to make the best health decisions for themselves and their families during all 
                stages of the pregnancy, birth, and the post-birth period, that power will have a 
                transformational impact on their family and community.</p>

            <p>"[Black Women Birthing Justice's] vision is that every pregnant person has an empowering birth and postpartum 
                experience, free of unnecessary medical interventions and forced separation from 
                their child, one that honors their autonomy and maintains dignity. [BBWJ] aim[s] to educate 
                and inform, to document and share Black women and individuals’ birth stories in 
                their own words, to raise awareness, influence healthcare policy, and keep birth 
                sacred. We challenge human rights violations, including maternal mortality and near 
                misses, and rebuild confidence in our Black and Brown community’s ability to birth."</p>
